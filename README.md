# WTC_PythonChallenge
Extra credit challenge

While attending Western Technical College my CEH Teacher presented this challenge:

1) Use Python 3 in Kali, Linux to create a list
2) The list interactions need to be able to:
a) view the list
b) modify (i.e. add or remove item)
c) save the list and recall upon re-entering program
3) the programm must remain open through all functions until user selects to exit

This is the end result I turned in. As of now, you have to have both files to have the program run and experiment with it.

Still a working progress as I learn more.
